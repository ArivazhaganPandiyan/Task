    <h1>Objects and its internal representation in Javascript</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript objects are like containers that hold information. They help organize data, just like filling in details on a form. Whether describing a person or a car, objects make it easy to represent real-world things in code.
    </p>

    <h2>Objects: Data Organizers</h2>
    <p>
        Objects are created using literal notation or constructors, acting like handy organizers for different pieces of information.
    </p>

    <h2>Inside the Box: Dictionary Representation</h2>
    <p>
        Internally, JavaScript starts with a dictionary-like catalog, where each property has its entry with a corresponding value. Simple but not the quickest for accessing data.
    </p>

    <h2>Magic Transformation: Hidden Classes and Quick Guides</h2>
    <p>
        Objects evolve with hidden classes, acting as blueprints. When an object matches a hidden class, accessing its properties becomes faster and smoother, thanks to inline caching.
    </p>

    <h2>Family Ties: Prototypes and Inheritance</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript introduces a family tree concept with prototype-based inheritance. Objects inherit traits from others, creating an organized chain for sharing functionalities.
    </p>

    <h2>Memory Cleanup: Garbage Collection</h2>
    <p>
        Unused objects are gracefully removed through garbage collection, freeing up memory resources for more important tasks.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion: </h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript objects, with their simplicity and behind-the-scenes magic, help us build organized, efficient, and elegant code. Understanding their internal dance enriches our coding journey, making our digital landscapes more vibrant and dynamic.
